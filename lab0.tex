1) What did you do over last summer, or what are you planning to do this upcoming summer?
	This last summer I worked in Alaska at a fish processing plant. Wasn't very enjoyable, but it was pretty decent money. This upcoming summer I'm doing a computer engineering internship in Salt Lake City for Hill Air Force Base.

2) What do you personally want to get out of this lab?
	I am looking forward to improving my skills in python and getting to the point where I can do math much easier using python than other traditional methods.
